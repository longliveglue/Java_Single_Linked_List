# Java_Single_Linked_List
This is an exercise in creating a Single Linked List.

Step 1. Make a node with the following methods. 

**setNext(NodeNode nextNode)** 
// This is check if the next node is null. If it is null then we will add the nextObj to it. 
If its not null we will then ask it to add an object to itself.

**next()** 
//This will load the next item.

printList() 
//This will print the entire contents of the Single linked list.
